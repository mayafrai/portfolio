      <strong> Onboarding at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic</strong>

  <br><br>
  I joined YouTube as an Associate Product Manager in April of 2020. I onboarded at the heart of the pandemic, the time when everyone was still expecting the pandemic to last 2 weeks and that we’ll all be back in the office in no time. When I joined, the live sports industry was undergoing a very slow and rather tumultuous transition due to the pandemic. Little did I know I’d be caught up in the middle of it during my first couple of months. I joined as an APM, which means you work on two different teams the 2 years you’re there as a new grad product manager. The team that got me on board was the YouTube Ads Strategic Bets team. Similar to how Google coined “Strategic Bets” to represent Google X, Waymo, Verily, etc as their high-risk teams working on the next big thing, YouTube’s Strategic Bets team in the Ads organization primarily focuses on YouTube’s growth in streaming and live TV.

      <br><br>

      The first project I was tasked with on getting out the door was executing a full-scale monetization plan for YouTube’s exclusive live sports deal with Major League Baseball. A bit of context here - as an APM, you’re thrown into the deep end expected to graciously swim and make it out to the other side with flying colors. This is primarily why I joined the program - to get challenged and be exposed to business models at Google, launch products for global audiences, connect with cross-functional teams, and strengthen my execution and strategic skill-set. The deep end here was balancing incentives and needs across YouTube’s 3-sided marketplace (advertisers, viewers, content providers) all the while attempting to understand the nuts and bolts of live sports (as of Brazilian heritage, i’m a soccer fan but knew close to nothing about American baseball). Time was of the essence, there was no such thing as a “slow ramp-up.” I’d had to understand the systems entirely to be able to make rapid decisions and ensure we were in a good place to launch by the end of April. This meant executing live testing on spring training games as a start, aligning teams on development goals, soliciting advertiser sponsorship commitments, and setting forth our post-launch expansion strategy for non-sports partners.
<br><br>

You can imagine that just like all of us, live sports was also on lockdown. Our team across sales, product, engineering, marketing, and operations were patiently waiting for the greenlight from the MLB to start the season. On the monetization side, our product had yet to be fully tested. Our launch was entirely dependent on our ability to serve ads in real-time and our launch plan had gotten derailed by the possibility there would be no live sports season. As a product manager, you’re the one expected to get your team to launch and unblock team- and product-wide challenges. For me, the challenge was in maintaining momentum with my team to ensure we were always ready to launch at any given time MLB may tell us we’re on (could have been in a day or in a month). The second implication was ensuring that our product would be in good shape down the line. We were scoping a 2-3 year product plan and if we missed a test opportunity, we’d be set back to pursue future live content deals. Four months later, after lengthy negotiations with our content partnership teams and countless adjustments to launch plans, MLB gave us word that they would be giving us 4 mixed exclusive games to stream on YouTube throughout the month of September.
<br><br>


By the end of it, we were relieved to have gotten something out of the waiting game and could test key system capabilities of our product.

<strong> A $15 billion dollar advertising machine</strong>


<br><br>

In 2020, for the first time Google reported YouTube’s annual revenue - amounting to the platform bringing in $15 billion a year (~10% of Google’s total annual revenue). YouTube’s core business is in advertising - selling the best content made and distributed on the platform to advertisers so viewers can watch the content on any device for free.

<br><br>

YouTube’s focus on advertising is entirely based on its founding mission: “give everyone a voice and show them the world.” Distributing content on the internet should be without a cost to the viewer and YouTube has made its business viable through selling content.

<br><br>

Content on YouTube is spread across 4 categories: AVOD (ad-supported video on demand e.g. any video with ads), TVOD (transaction video on demand e.g. pay for a movie), PVOD (premium video on demand e.g. pay for YouTube Premium to watch ad-free videos), and Live (e.g. creator live streams or live events like Coachella).
<br><br>

Each of the above categories have their own sales strategy. First, YouTube strategizes selling based on the kind of advertiser that would be buying the content (in sales terms: are they upfront, scatter, or auction buyers)?

<br><br>
YouTube’s growth has largely been its ability to disrupt the traditional TV advertising market. Some additional context here: advertisers consider players like YouTube, Facebook, and Amazon as part of their “digital” spending vs their “TV” spending. Over the years, advertising from TV has shifted to digital as a result of the above platforms’ popularity, engagement, and better measurement and targeting capabilities. COVID-19 has accelerated this shift even further.

<br><br>
Media buying has largely stayed the same way since the Mad Men era: advertiser buying through what’s called an Upfront, the primary avenue for Reservation-based advertisers (advertisers looking for guaranteed impressions) to make buying commitments for an entire TV season and secure low, negotiated pricing for high-value inventory. Upfront buyers are typically large ad agencies like GroupM, an agency responsible for purchasing ~$63 billion in ads each year (clients include Google, Unilever, Ford, and more). YouTube will sell ads through the Upfront to sell the majority of its inventory to Reservation buyers. It will also target Scatter buyers, or Reservation advertisers booking commitments on a monthly or quarterly basis. Lastly, YouTube also sells their inventory to Auction buyers, the least-expensive of the bunch, where buyers aren’t looking for guaranteed commitments but rather the ad system is optimizing ad placements based on who’s the highest bidder.
<br><br>

<strong> Content is king, but you need more than just really good content</strong>

<br><br>
YouTube is known as a content platform and the primary way it makes money is through selling the value of the platform as an aggregator of the internet’s best content. For advertisers, they’re looking to evaluate the value of the content available (in sales terms; how valuable and/or scarce is the ad inventory)?

<br><br>
On my team, we are largely responsible for the way in which we monetize high value live content streams (like MLB live sports). For this type of content, brand advertisers book sponsorships to promote their products/services on high viewership streams. Given the high acquisition cost for live sports deals like the MLB and the NFL, our teams need to be able to recoup content costs with advertising dollars. Therefore, one way we aim to make the economics work is through selling live content directly to advertisers.


<br><br>
Similar to how advertisers group budgets, content providers divide distribution rights into digital and TV. Offering up exclusive content to a digital platform means TV providers lose out on the content to air on their local and national cable networks. Therefore, hand-shake deals made by the likes of Fox typically lead to exclusive deals being made across 2-5 year time frames where exclusive high-viewership games are entirely reserved for traditional TV providers vs emerging digital players.
<br><br>

On the flip side, leagues like the MLB, NFL, and NBA view YouTube as a digital technology partner. Being able to partner with YouTube means both a young audience reach (cord-cutters) as well as access to interactive product features. YouTube’s negotiations with content partners for exclusive content often aims to strike a balance between incremental audiences (people moving away from traditional TV) and unique platform capabilities (live chat, search and discovery, digital scoreboards and player stats).

<br><br>
On the other hand, advertising is not only the business of selling content directly. Content is one piece of the puzzle. When considering booking $xxM on a platform, advertisers consider content as a secondary factor - other primary factors being reach (e.g. unique audience viewership), safety (e.g. brand suitability), perception (e.g. brand association), and additional market solutions they can receive as added benefits (e.g. measurement, targeting, brand lift).
<br><br>

Although YouTube may sell sports packages for the MLB or Coachella, YouTube scales platform-wide content as a broad buy for a higher value offering.
<br><br>

One of the largest successes for YouTube Ads is a bundled content offering called YouTube Select (formerly known as Google Preferred). It packages the best content on YouTube with respect to viewership, likes/comments/subscribes, and overall engagement across numerous content categories (gaming, comedy, music, sports, etc). Advertisers optimizing for brand awareness book YouTube Select campaigns to achieve global audience reach (2 billion viewers) and run across a wide array of content with human-reviewed brand suitability.
<br><br>

For scarce inventory (content that isn’t available throughout the entire year), sellers would sell based on individual packages. For YouTube Select, the value is both the quantity and quality of the content available (e.g. thousands of videos users watch over the year). In other offerings, advertisers are interested in scarcity - this is especially pertinent for live content like the MLB which only runs in seasons and may be exclusive to one digital or TV platform.
<br><br>

<strong> YouTube is a well-oiled machine, but growth will always come at the expense of balancing act</strong>
<br><br>

Overall, YouTube is a well-oiled and scalable ads and content business - growing year over year with a mission to distribute the best video content globally, whether that means competing with the likes of Amazon / Hulu or Instagram / Snapchat.
<br><br>

Because YouTube has to manage partnerships with content providers (e.g. HBO, ABC) in addition to creators (e.g. Emma Chamberlain, Mr. Beast), growth efforts often get stalled by conflicting priorities for two disparate parties. The difficulty lies in being able to compete in a social environment as well as against streaming giants. I look forward to keeping tabs on YouTube’s continuous new content launches across live sports, entertainment, and creator content.
