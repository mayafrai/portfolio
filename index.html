            <p class="byline"> "[A]rt can only be created by people (or other independent actors) capable of [certain] kinds of social relationships. In contrast, while we can get emotionally attached to our computers and other possessions, we feel no real empathy for their emotions, no ethical duty toward them, and no need to demonstrate our feelings toward them. This means computers cannot be credited as artists until they have some kind of personhood, just as people do not give gifts to their coffeemakers or marry their cars. If there is ever such a thing as human-level AI, with thoughts, feelings, and moral status comparable to ours, then it would be able to create art. But ‚Äúhuman-level AI‚Äù is pure science fiction right now." </p>

If you‚Äôre building an airplane that‚Äôs just going to haul cargo back and forth, the human experience is not prioritized. Once you have passengers, then you start to consider everything about the human experience: aesthetics, comfort, and ergonomics. Silicon Valley was a lot like that, which is why for a long time we saw this na√Øve expression in our software interfaces. There was almost an endearing primitivism to it. So I‚Äôd find myself hiring people from New York or Hollywood to do these things. But it‚Äôs changing."</p>

She's designed an end-to-end guidance and inspiration tool for 15M+ SMB Pages admins at Facebook and led growth research and strategy for rental subscription models at Rent the Runway. At Cornell, she led a mobility product team with over 11K downloads and co-founded a community program for side projects called Backyard.
